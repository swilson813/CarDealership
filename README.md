# Dealership Workshop

This is my 4th workshop. This specific one required me to create an inventory system or
a car dealership & also prepare many layer such as
vin, make, model, vehicle type, mileage, year, odometer & color
to create easy usage for not only dealership employees but also customers.

- - This is my interesting code for this read me because i'm always fascinated with
    the idea of parsing & forcing a format through when it's normally the other way around dealing with IntelliJ.
